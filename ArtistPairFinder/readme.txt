Folder include 3 files:
Parfinder.java
ArtistPairFinder.jar
Artist_lists_small.txt

Source code is in the java file, the algorithm complexity is 0(M*n2) where M is the number of lines in the file and n is the lengh of a line.
This solution scann all the pairs so it assure the correct result. A combinatoria approach could be usedm but the algorithm is so fast (execution time<5sec) that there is not need of finding an approsimate solution.

The JAR file will run the program and create a txt output file in the same folder.
NOTE the Artist_lists_small.txt has to be in the same forlde of the JAR file in order to work
